# Multi-Head Attention Layer for Transformers

This repository contains a custom implementation of the Multi-Head Attention mechanism, a fundamental component in transformer models, built from scratch using TensorFlow. The Multi-Head Attention layer enables transformer models to attend to different parts of the input sequence independently, enhancing their ability to capture complex patterns in sequential data.

## Overview

The `MultiHeadAttention` layer is designed to handle sequences of tokens, often representing words or embeddings, and computes attention scores that dictate how much each token attends to other tokens within the sequence. This layer is crucial for tasks such as machine translation, summarization, and other sequence-to-sequence tasks.

### Key Features

- **MultiHeadAttention Class**: Includes methods for splitting the input into multiple heads, computing scaled dot-product attention, and aggregating the results.
- **Usage Examples**: Demonstrates how to initialize and use the `MultiHeadAttention` layer with random input tensors.
- **Attention Visualization**: Provides visualization of attention weights using heatmaps to illustrate attention distribution across different tokens and heads.

## Implementation Details

The `MultiHeadAttention` class is implemented with the following key components:

- Input projection layers (`wq`, `wk`, `wv`) to transform the input sequence into query, key, and value representations.
- Splitting of the transformed inputs into multiple heads, allowing for parallelized attention computations.
- Scaled dot-product attention mechanism to compute attention scores.
- Optional masking functionality (`mask` parameter) to handle scenarios like masking out padding tokens.

## Usage

To use the `MultiHeadAttention` layer, follow these steps:

1. Instantiate the `MultiHeadAttention` class with desired parameters (`d_model`, `num_heads`).
2. Provide input tensors (`q`, `k`, `v`) to the layer's `call` method along with an optional mask.
3. Retrieve the output tensor and attention weights from the `call` method.

Refer to the provided code examples for detailed usage demonstrations.

## Dependencies

- TensorFlow 2.x
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Usage Examples

The provided usage examples demonstrate how to initialize and use the `MultiHeadAttention` layer with random input tensors. Additionally, there is an example showcasing the usage of the `MultiHeadAttention` layer within a transformer-based machine translation model using the Hugging Face transformers library.

Feel free to explore this repository and use the `MultiHeadAttention` layer in your transformer-based projects. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out!
